# Find Recipe
### About Find Recipe
The Find recipe app allows users to search for recipes with the ingredients they have. However, in this application you can search for recipes by name and 
download the recipe you want to your phone. When you search with the materials in hand, the application offers you 2 lists. The first is the recipes 
that contain only the ingredients you have and the second is the recipes that contain some of the ingredients. You can select and download any recipe from any of these lists.
You can access the recipes you downloaded offline. If you don't want to search with the ingredients you have, you can also search with the titles of the recipes.
